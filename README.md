Open Optical Network Emulator & Diagnostic Suite
# Project Concept
The Open Optical Network Emulator & Diagnostic Suite is a modular tool designed to simulate and diagnose the behavior of optical network components, such as transponders, muxponders, and ROADMs. It aims to mimic a real-world packet-optical transport system, providing both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a web interface for comprehensive diagnostics, testing, and simulation. This project is ideal for demonstrating strong skills in systems-level programming, networking, automation, performance optimization, and real-world applicability, particularly relevant to companies like Ciena.

# Why This Project Stands Out
Relevance to Industry: Directly mirrors the kind of complex systems work performed on advanced platforms like Ciena's 6500 series.

Versatile Skill Demonstration: Showcases proficiency across systems programming (C/C++), scripting (Python, Bash), automation, testing, and deployment.

Open-Source Potential: Offers a valuable resource for academic research, laboratory simulations, or as a foundational tool for network engineers.

Scalability: Designed with modularity in mind, allowing for future expansion to support real hardware integration or compatibility with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controllers.

# Features
Core Optical Network Emulation: Simulate various optical components (transponders, muxponders, ROADMs) and their interactions.

Signal Flow Simulation: Model signal degradation, latency, and error rates within the emulated network.

Object-Oriented Design: Modular representation of network elements (nodes, links, amplifiers) using C/C++.

Comprehensive Diagnostics: CLI and web interfaces for real-time monitoring and diagnostic insights.

Automated Testing Framework: Python-based framework for running automated tests against the emulator.

Data Visualization: Python tools for visualizing key metrics like signal strength over time and error rates.

Linux Daemon/Service: Ability to run the emulator as a background service for continuous operation.

System Integration: Bash scripts for deployment, robust logging, and system monitoring, including integration with systemd, cron jobs, and logrotate.

# Bonus Features
Network Management Protocol Support: Simulate real-world network management by adding support for SNMP or NetConf.

CI/CD Integration: Include unit and integration tests with CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated validation.

Containerization: Docker support for easy and consistent deployment across different environments.
